  ABSTRACT       = {People are the main reason for the deterioration of indoor air quality (IAQ) due to the continuous physiological metabolism processes in their bodies, including respiration. We present results from an investigation of the influence of indoor air temperature on the concentration of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2). The investigation was preconditioned by previous findings on the effect of air temperature on human metabolism. However, our literature survey showed a lack of studies on the influence of the indoor air temperature on the exhaled CO2 (or metabolic CO2), which leads to the novelty of our results. Our experiments had two phases: measurement in a university classroom with an installed heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system during regular classes and measurement in a specially designed small climate chamber, where the time variations of the CO2 concentrations, together with some physiological parameters, were measured. Two indoor air temperatures were set: 23 °C and 27 °C. The results obtained and their respective analyses show the strong effect of the two air temperatures on the CO2 concentration due to exhalation. In the classroom, the CO2 concentration at 27 °C was higher by 6.2% than at 23 °C. In the climate chamber, the CO2 concentration at 27 °C was higher by 9.6% than at 23 °C. Physiological parameters (oxygen saturation pressure, pulse rate, end-tidal CO2, and respiration rate) and their dependence on the air temperature were also measured in the climate chamber, establishing an effect of the temperature on the pulse rate.},

Particularly, 22.7% decrease in NO2 and 3.0% increase of O3 was observed in Tianjin, nonlinear relationship between O3 generation and NO2 implied that synergetic control of NOx and VOCs is needed. Deteriorating meteorological condition during the COVID-19 lockdown obscured the actual PM2.5 reduction. Fireworks transport in 2020 Spring Festival (SF) triggered regional haze pollution. PM2.5 during the COVID-19 lockdown only reduced by 5.6% in Tianjin. Here we used the dispersion coefficient to normalize the measured PM2.5 (DN-PM2.5), aiming to eliminate the adverse meteorological impact and roughly estimate the actual PM2.5 reduction, which reduced by 17.7% during the COVID-19 lockdown. In terms of PM2.5 chemical composition, significant NO3− increase was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, as a tracer of atmospheric oxidation capacity, odd oxygen (Ox = NO2 + O3) was observed to reduce during the COVID-19 lockdown, whereas relative humidity (RH), specific humidity and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) were observed with noticeable enhancement. Nitrogen oxidation rate (NOR) was observed to increase at higher specific humidity and ALWC, especially in the haze episode occurred during 2020SF, high air humidity and obvious nitrate generation was observed. Anomalously enhanced air humidity may response for the nitrate increase during the COVID-19 lockdown period.}

  ABSTRACT = {Spraying roads with water on a large scale in Chinese cities is one of the supplementary precaution or mitigation actions implemented to control severe air pollution events or heavy haze-fog events in which the mechanisms causing them are not yet fully understood. These air pollution events were usually characterized by higher air humidity. Therefore, there may be a link between this action and air pollution. In the present study, the impact of water spraying on the PM2.5 concentration and humidity in air was assessed by measuring chemical composition of the water, undertaking a simulated water spraying experiment, measuring residues and analyzing relevant data. We discovered that spraying large quantities of tap or river water on the roads leads to increased PM2.5 concentration and humidity, and that daily continuous spraying produces a cumulative effect on air pollution. Spraying the same amount of water produces greater increases in humidity and PM2.5 concentration during cool autumn and winter than during hot summer. Our results demonstrate that spraying roads with water increases, rather than decreases, the concentration of PM2.5 and thus is a new source of anthropogenic aerosol and air pollution. The higher vapor content and resultant humidity most likely create unfavorable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of air pollution in autumn and winter with low temperature.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor-based gas sensors have been applied to a variety of applications, including environmental, safety, and health monitoring. Extensive efforts have been made to improve sensing performance outcomes, with the majority of these efforts focusing on the sensor response, sensitivity, and selectivity issues, mainly by optimizing the sensing materials and sensor structures. However, low-frequency noise (LFN), which has a considerable impact on the stability and reliability of sensors, has received far less attention in gas sensor research. In gas sensing applications, the noise in the sensing signal is determined by the LFN due to the slow reaction process. Thus, it is necessary to characterize the LFN in semiconductor-based gas sensors. This review article presents an overview of the LFN in semiconductor-based gas sensors. First, the history of LFN in gas sensor studies is explored briefly. Then, we discuss noise generation mechanisms in resistor-type, thin-film transistor-type, and horizontal floating-gate field-effect-transistor-type gas sensors. On the basis of this information, the signal-to-noise ratio, which determines the limit of detection, is examined, and the method to optimize the SNR in each sensor platform is discussed. Finally, LFN spectroscopy for selective gas detection is introduced, and its working principle is analyzed. This review article provides a foundation for understanding the LFN in semiconductor-based gas sensors and methods to control it based on application requirements.}

  ABSTRACT = {We discuss the implementation challenges of gas sensing systems based on low-frequency noise measurements on chemoresistive sensors. Resistance fluctuations in various gas sensing materials, in a frequency range typically up to a few kHz, can enhance gas sensing by considering its intensity and the slope of power spectral density. The issues of low-frequency noise measurements in resistive gas sensors, specifically in two-dimensional materials exhibiting gas-sensing properties, are considered. We present measurement setups and noise-processing methods for gas detection. The chemoresistive sensors show various DC resistances requiring different flicker noise measurement approaches. Separate noise measurement setups are used for resistances up to a few hundred kΩ and for resistances with much higher values. Noise measurements in highly resistive materials (e.g., MoS2, WS2, and ZrS3) are prone to external interferences but can be modulated using temperature or light irradiation for enhanced sensing. Therefore, such materials are of considerable interest for gas sensing.},

As VG increased, the slow traps were filled and thus γ decreased, stabilizing at ≈0.95. Various other parameters extracted from the LFN indicated that the carrier number fluctuation (Δn) model was the dominant origin of the LFN.
